# Rapid-Covid-19-Detection-using-CNN-on-Chest-X-Ray

# 1.	Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has made fast and accurate diagnosis essential. Traditional tests like RT-PCR are slow and resource-heavy, so there's interest in using chest X-rays (CXR) as a quicker, cheaper alternative. However, reading CXR images requires special expertise and can vary by the reader. Automating CXR interpretation to identify normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 changes could speed up and improve diagnosis accuracy.
# 2.	Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create an AI system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically analyze chest X-ray images. We plan to train CNN to categorize the images into three groups: normal, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19. The training will use a diverse set of 1823 posteroanterior (PA) CXR images from different sources and studies. Our aim is to build a reliable model that can quickly assist healthcare professionals with accurate diagnoses. This project will not only help speed up the detection of COVID-19 and other viral infections but will also provide a public dataset to support further AI research in medical imaging.
